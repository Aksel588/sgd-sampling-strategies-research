## Abstract
This research analyzes how data sampling and ordering strategies influence the convergence behavior of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).  
We compare uniform sampling with replacement and random reshuffling without replacement, revealing the trade-offs between randomness and structure in stochastic optimization.

## Key Topics
- Uniform sampling vs. random reshuffling
- Convergence rates under constant and diminishing step sizes
- Deterministic data orderings
- Adversarial data ordering and security implications
- Practical considerations in large-scale ML systems
